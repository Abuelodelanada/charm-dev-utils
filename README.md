## How to launch a VM using cloud-init script

Let's say you need to launch a VM using [Multipass](https://multipass.run/) that runs `juju 3.0/stable` with:

- 4G RAM
- 3 CPUs
- 30G disk
- and mounting your `repos` directory inside the ubuntu user home directory

you may run:

```shell
multipass launch --cloud-init charm-dev-juju-3.0.yaml \
--timeout 1200 \
--name charm-dev-juju-3 \
--memory 4G \
--cpus 3 \
--disk 30G \
--mount /home/jose/trabajos/canonical/repos:/home/ubuntu/repos
```

Once the VM is ready you will see:

```
Launched: charm-dev-juju-3
Mounted '/home/jose/trabajos/canonical/repos' into 'charm-dev-juju-3:/home/ubuntu/repos'
```

Now you can jump into the new VM:

```shell
multipass shell charm-dev-juju-3
```

```shell

And voilà, you have a VM with all you need to start developing Charmed Operators!


## zsh_themes

In the `zsh_themes` directory you will find a `juju.zsh-theme` that uses the [`juju`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/juju) plugin to show a prompt with juju information about controller and model.
